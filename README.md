# moodle-message_pushsafer
Pushsafer plugin for moodle.org

This plugin is a message provider that allows push notifications via the pushsafer.com service. An private key is required from pushsafer.com to allow for messages to be sent to your client devices. Each client device needs the client application (available for Android, iOS, iPhone, iPad, Windows 10 Phone & Desktop) to work correctly.

Once installed, configure the message provider with the private key, and the devices which should recieve push notifications. Then configure which messages are to be sent as push notifications. All done!
